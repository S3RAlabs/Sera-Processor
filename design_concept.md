# Design Concept: Minimalist Word Processor

## 1. Aesthetic: Silicon Valley

The application will embody the "Silicon Valley" aesthetic, characterized by:

*   **Minimalism:** Clean, uncluttered interface with a focus on essential functionality.
*   **Modern & Flat Design:** Use of simple shapes, clean lines, and a lack of skeuomorphic elements.
*   **Typography:** Emphasis on clear, legible typography. We will use a sans-serif font like Inter or SF Pro Display.
*   **Color Palette:** A simple color palette with a neutral background (white or light gray) and a single accent color for interactive elements. We will use a palette of #FFFFFF (white), #F2F2F7 (light gray), and #007AFF (blue accent).
*   **White Space:** Generous use of white space to create a sense of calm and focus.

## 2. Architecture

The application will be built using Electron, a framework for creating native applications with web technologies like JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

*   **Main Process:** Handles window creation and other system-level interactions.
*   **Renderer Process:** The user interface of the application, built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 3. Functionality

The word processor will have the following core features:

*   **Text Editing:** Basic text input and editing.
*   **File Operations:** Create, open, and save files.
*   **Minimal Formatting:** Bold, italic, and underline.
*   **No Distractions:** The UI will be designed to be as unobtrusive as possible, allowing the user to focus on writing.

## 4. Inspiration

We are inspired by the design of modern productivity apps and the minimalist aesthetic of companies like Apple and Google.
